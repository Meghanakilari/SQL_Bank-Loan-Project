# SQL_Bank-Loan-Project
 SQL queries used to generate comprehensive reports for bank loan data. The queries cover various key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, funded amounts, amounts received, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. The repository also includes analyses based on employee length, loan purpose, and home ownership status.
